I created a website utilising Flask and machine learning to
forecast graduate admissions from the perspective of India.The
model will operate under certain conditions, including GRE,
TOEFL University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research. Under
these conditions, the model will forecast the percentages of
applicants who will be admitted to foreign universities.The ML
model is converted into a product using Flask.This website will
estimate a candidate's likelihood of admission to foreign
universities or colleges, which may help the applicant secure
admission overseas.
